                                Turkey's Erdogan urges French goods boycott amid Islam row
                            </h5>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has called on Turks to boycott French goods amid
                                a row over France's tougher stance on radical Islam.

                                In a televised speech, he urged world leaders to protect Muslims "if there is oppression
                                against Muslims in France".

                                Mr Erdogan has angrily criticised French President Emmanuel Macron for pledging to
                                defend secularism against radical Islam.

                                It comes after a teacher was killed for showing Prophet Muhammad cartoons.

                                Samuel Paty was beheaded on 16 October by 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov outside Paris.
                                France "will not give up our cartoons", President Macron said earlier this week.

                                Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam, and are
                                offensive to many Muslims.

                                But state secularism - or laïcité - is central to France's national identity. Curbing
                                freedom of expression to protect the feelings of one particular community undermines
                                unity, the state says.

                                What's the dispute about?
                                Mr Erdogan called for the boycott in a televised speech on Monday.

                                "Never give credit to French-labelled goods, don't buy them," he said in the capital
                                Ankara.

                                He said Muslims are now "subjected to a lynch campaign similar to that against Jews in
                                Europe before World War II", adding that "European leaders should tell the French
                                president to stop his hate campaign".

                                Over the weekend, Mr Erdogan said Mr Macron needed a mental health check for speaking
                                out so forcefully on Islam - comments that caused France to recall its ambassador to
                                Turkey for consultations.

                                It came after Mr Macron pledged to defend secularism and tackle radical Islam in the
                                wake of the killing of Mr Paty.

                                Two weeks before the attack, Mr Macron described Islam as a religion "in crisis" and
                                announced new measures to tackle what he called "Islamist separatism".

                                France has Western Europe's largest Muslim population, and some accuse the authorities
                                of using secularism to target them.

                                European leaders have come out in support of France. Germany expressed "solidarity" with
                                Mr Macron after the Turkish president's comments, with government spokesman Steffen
                                Seibert calling the remarks "defamatory" and "completely unacceptable" and foreign
                                minister Heiko Maas calling Mr Erdogan's personal attacks "a particular low point".

                                Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the Netherlands "stands firmly with France and for
                                the collective values of the European Union", while Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe
                                Conte also expressed his "full solidarity" with Mr Macron.

                                "Personal insults do not help the positive agenda that the EU wants to pursue with
                                Turkey," he wrote in a tweet.

                                But Turkey is not the only country to criticise Mr Macron's comments. Pakistan's Prime
                                Minister Imran Khan accused the French president of "attacking Islam" in a tweet on
                                Sunday, while French products have been removed from some shops in Kuwait, Jordan and
                                Qatar. There have also been protests in Iraq, Libya, Syria and the Gaza Strip.

                                Citing Turkey's statistical institute, Reuters news agency reports that France is the
                                10th biggest source of imports into Turkey. The French company Renault is reportedly one
                                of the leading car brands by sales in the country.

                                How are France's relations with Turkey?
                                Mr Erdogan's calls for a boycott come after months of rising tensions between France and
                                Turkey.

                                While both countries are Nato members, they support differing sides in the ongoing
                                conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, as well as in Libya's civil war.

                                Mr Macron has also clashed with Mr Erdogan over Turkish oil and gas exploration in
                                disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean. France deployed jets and a frigate to the
                                region in August amid the tensions.

                                Vaccine hopes rise as Oxford jab prompts immune response among old as well as young
                                adults
                            </h5>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                One of the world’s leading COVID-19 experimental vaccines produces an immune response in
                                both young and old adults, raising hopes of a path out of the gloom and economic
                                destruction wrought by the novel coronavirus.

                                The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, also triggers lower adverse
                                responses among the elderly, British drug maker AstraZeneca Plc, which is helping
                                manufacture the vaccine, said on Monday.

                                A vaccine that works is seen as a game-changer in the battle against the novel
                                coronavirus, which has killed more than 1.15 million people, shuttered swathes of the
                                global economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.

                                “It is encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and
                                younger adults and that reactogenicity was lower in older adults, where the COVID-19
                                disease severity is higher,” an AstraZeneca spokesman said.

                                “The results further build the body of evidence for the safety and immunogenicity of
                                AZD1222,” the spokesman said, referring to the technical name of the vaccine.

                                The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is expected to be one of the first from big pharma to
                                secure regulatory approval, along with Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate, as the world
                                tries to plot a path out of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                                The news that older people get an immune response from the vaccine is positive because
                                the immune system weakens with age and older people are those most at risk of dying from
                                the virus.

                                If it works, a vaccine would allow the world to return to some measure of normality
                                after the tumult of the pandemic.

                                British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said a vaccine was not yet ready but he was
                                preparing logistics for a possible roll out mostly in the first half of 2021.

                                Asked if some people could receive a vaccine this year he told the BBC: “I don’t rule
                                that out but that is not my central expectation.”

                                “The programme is progressing well, (but) we’re not there yet,” Hancock said.

                                COMMON COLD VIRUS
                                Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the
                                viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes
                                infections in chimpanzees.

                                The chimpanzee cold virus has been genetically changed to include the genetic sequence
                                of the so-called spike protein which the coronavirus uses to gain entry to human cells.
                                The hope is that the human body will then attack the novel coronavirus if it sees it
                                again.

                                Immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a subset of older participants echo data
                                released in July which showed the vaccine generated “robust immune responses” in a group
                                of healthy adults aged between 18 and 55, the Financial Times reported earlier.

                                Details of the finding are expected to be published shortly in a clinical journal, the
                                FT said. It did not name the publication.

                                People aware of the results from so-called immunogenicity blood tests carried out on a
                                subset of older participants say the findings echo data released in July that showed the
                                vaccine generated “robust immune responses” in a group of healthy adults aged between 18
                                and 55.

                                AstraZeneca has signed several supply and manufacturing deals with companies and
                                governments around the world as it gets closer to reporting early results of a
                                late-stage clinical trial.

                                It resumed the U.S. trial of the experimental vaccine after approval by U.S. regulators,
                                the company said on Friday.

                                Staff at a London hospital trust have been told to be ready to receive the first batches
                                of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, The Sun newspaper reported on Monday.

                                India To Sign Deal To Access Precision Data From US Military Satellites
                            </h5>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                Last week, the US said it was watching the India-China standoff in Ladakh closely to
                                ensure that the situation did not escalate.

                                India will gain access to precision data and topographical images - on a real time basis
                                - from United States military satellites under an agreement to be signed during the
                                ongoing visit of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Mark Esper.
                                The agreement to share this data - BECA (Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement) - is
                                the third and final "foundational" understanding the US has with close international
                                partners. The two countries have already signed agreements to exchange military
                                logistics and enable secure communications.

                                In a statement released on Monday the government said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and
                                his American counterpart, Mr Esper, expressed satisfaction that BECA would be signed
                                during this visit and also at the close engagements between the armed forces of the two
                                countries.

                                They also reviewed bilateral defence spanning military-to-military cooperation, secure
                                communications systems and information sharing, and also discussed potential new areas
                                of cooperation.

                                Rajnath Singh said the talks would add "new vigour" to India-US defence relations and
                                cooperation.

                                Mr Esper also welcomed Australia's participation in next month's Malabar exercise - a
                                series of annual drills that began in 1992 to reinforce cooperation between Indian and
                                American naval forces.

                                India, with the US, Japan and Australia will hold the high-level Malabar naval exercise
                                next month. Australia is returning to these exercises for the first time since 2007 when
                                its participation drew criticism from China.

                                Last week, the US said it was watching the India-China standoff in Ladakh closely and
                                sharing information with Delhi. The US said it wanted to ensure that the situation did
                                not escalate.

                                Mike Pompeo and Mark Esper are in India for the third edition of the 2+2 talks with
                                their Indian counterparts - Rajnath Singh and Foreign Minister S Jaishankar. These
                                dialogues come days before the US votes in national polls, with President Donald Trump
                                bidding for re-election.

                                Ahead of the talks, which are scheduled to start on Tuesday and will include discussions
                                on regional security cooperation, military-to-military interaction and defence trade,
                                the US State Department said it welcomed India's emergence as a leading regional and
                                global power.

                                The first 2+2 talks were held in Delhi in September 2018 and the second in Washington,
                                D.C. in 2019.

                                J&K’s Accession Day with India celebrated with enthusiasm
                            </h5>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                The Accession Day of J&K with rest of India was on Monday celebrated with enthusiasm
                                across Jammu and Kashmir and with the government for the first time announcing a holiday
                                to mark the historical day. The J&K State Forces had on this day thwarted the attempt of
                                Pakistani raiders to capture vital installations in Kashmir whereafter the Indian Army
                                landed in Srinagar and protected the airport from falling in the hands of the enemy.

                                Political parties, including the BJP, Congress and Panthers Party, organized functions
                                to mark the day. The BJP organized Tiranga March in the main cities of Jammu and
                                Srinagar and also at district headquarters.

                                The march in Jammu was led by the UT BJP chief Ravinder Raina from Gandhi Nagar colony
                                just near the office of the Peoples Democratic Front.

                                BJP activists organized celebrations for the first time in Srinagar where they danced
                                and sang on the main streets. A Tiranga Yatra with party activists carrying the Indian
                                National Flag through the city was also organized.

                                Today’s was the first Accession Day that was celebrated after J&K becoming a Union
                                Territory (UT). The previous Kashmir-centric governments did not give any importance to
                                the historical day as they have been projecting J&K a disputed territory by demanding
                                permanent solution of the Kashmir problem.

                                It was on this day in 1947 when the then ruler Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument
                                of Accession joining Jammu and Kashmir with the dominion of India.

                                At least four BJP activists from Kupwara were taken into custody in the morning by the
                                police for trying to hoist the Tricolour at the clock tower in Srinagar’s Lal Chowk.

                                The J&K Police organized an 8-km “Run for Unity” in the memory of police martyrs in
                                south Kashmir’s Awantipura. As many as 184 boys and girls participated in the run.

                                Senior superintendent of police, Tahir Saleem, said that the event was organized to
                                honour the police martyrs for their courage, valour and sacrifices for the unity and
                                integrity of the country.

                                Vikramaditya Singh, who is the grandson of Maharaj Hari Singh, while extending good
                                wishes on the day, tweeted; “On this day we also pay tributes to Brigadier Rajinder
                                Singh, MVC, chief of military staff, J&K State Forces. He gave the ultimate sacrifice
                                along with hundred soldiers defending the state from Pakistani raiders allowing time for
                                the Indian Army to fly in on 27th October 1947.

                                All citizens to get free COVID-19 vaccine, says Union Minister after backlash
                            </h5>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                Union Minister Pratap Sarangi on Sunday said that all people of the country will be
                                given free COVID vaccine, amidst the demand by opposition parties in the country for it
                                and not only in poll-bound Bihar as announced by the BJP.

                                The BJP announcement of free COVID vaccine for Bihar, where assembly polls begin this
                                week, had kicked up a controversy with the opposition parties tearing into the NDA
                                government alleging that the ruling party was using the pandemic for political reasons.



                                Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the announcement was in order as it
                                was an election manifesto announcement.

                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that all people will be provided free of cost
                                vaccines. An estimated Rs 500 odd will be spent on vaccination of each person, Sarangi
                                told reporters after addressing a campaign meeting for the November 3 assembly by-poll
                                in Balasore.

                                Modi had in a televised adddress to the nation on October 20 said that Indian scientists
                                are in the process of developing several vaccines that are at different stages of
                                clinical trials and the results seem encouraging.

                                Sarangi, the union minister of state for animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries and micro,
                                small and medium enterprises spoke in reply to question raised by Odisha Food Supplies
                                and Consumer Welfare Minister, R P Swain.

                                Swain had earlier in the day sought clarification from Dharmendra Pradhan and Sarangi,
                                the two union ministers from Odisha questioning them for their silence on their party
                                BJP's stand on free COVID-19 vaccination for the people of the state along the lines of
                                the one being promised in Bihar.

                                The governments of Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Assam and Puduchchery have already
                                announced free of cost COVID vaccines for the people of their states, while Delhi Chief
                                Minister Arvind Kejriwal has demanded free vaccine for all citizens across the country.

                                Swain had tweeted "I am asking questions to two Odisha union ministers from Balasore
                                soil to clarify as to why the people of the state will not get free of cost COVID
                                vaccine. The union ministers should clarify BJPs stand on the corona vaccination in
                                Odisha.

                                On the state governments steps for vaccination, Swain said it has signed an agreement
                                with a vaccine manufacturer and is committed to extend the facility to all people of the
                                state.

                                He, however, did not say whether the state government will provide the vaccine to the
                                people free of cost.

                                BJP deputy leader in Odisha Assembly Bishnu Charan Sethi said the Centre has been
                                supporting Odisha fully during the pandemic and has granted Rs 22,000 crore for the
                                purpose.

                                "But large scale lapses have been detected in the utilisation of the fund," he alleged.

                            </h5>

                                Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informs Bench that a new law may come out in the next few
                                days that proposes to have a permanent body to deal with stubble-burning.
                                The Supreme Court on Monday decided to “keep in abeyance” its pre-Dussehra order
                                appointing former Supreme Court judge Justice Madan B. Lokur to a one-man committee to
                                monitor/prevent stubble-burning in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab.

                                The decision to put on hold its October 16 order came soon after Solicitor General
                                Tushar Mehta informed a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde that the
                                Centre had “proposed a legislation to tackle the problem” which occurs annually and
                                chokes the Capital.

                                Mr. Mehta said the new law may come out in the next few days that proposed to have a
                                permanent body to deal with stubble-burning.

                                “Having regard to the statement made, we consider it appropriate that the measures
                                adopted in the order of October 16 be kept in abeyance until further orders,” the court
                                recorded in its order.

                                On October 16, the court asked Justice Lokur with the help of student volunteer forces
                                deployed from the National Cadet Corps, National Service Scheme and Bharat Scouts and
                                Guides to protect Delhi NCR from air pollution caused by stubble-burning in neighbouring
                                Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh this winter.

                                The court had said the student forces could patrol highways and fields in the three
                                States and ensure that no fires were started in the fields.

                                It asked the Chief Secretaries of the three States to provide facilities to the
                                committee and provide student volunteers with adequate transportation to aid their
                                vigil.

                                It directed the existing mobile teams and nodal officers of the States to report to the
                                committee.

                                The court chose Justice Lokur for the task as the retired judge had headed the Green
                                Bench which was monitoring stubble-burning for two whole years before his retirement.

                                His name was recommended by senior advocate Vikas Singh, who is appearing for two
                                children apprehensive about the onslaught of incoming waves of smog caused by unbridled
                                stubble burning in the three States this winter.

                                Mr. Singh voiced that the issue of stubble-burning had to be tackled without delay. Mr.
                                Mehta said the government shared the concerns of his clients.

                                The Bench said the court would opt for status quo till it studied the proposed law. A
                                hearing has been scheduled for Thursday.

                                The last time, Mr. Singh had said that stubble fires were five times more in Punjab
                                regardless of a remote-sensing app used by the State.

                                Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said that India's energy will energize the world.
                                Inaugurating the Fourth India Energy Forum by CERAWeek, Mr Modi said that energy
                                security is at the core of our efforts and country's energy future is bright and secure.

                                The Prime Minister said that a self-reliant India will also be a force multiplier for
                                the world economy. PM Modi said, with a smaller carbon footprint, our energy sector will
                                be growth-centric, industry-friendly and environment-conscious.

                                He said, that is why India is one of the most active nations in furthering renewable
                                source of energy. He said, India's energy plans aims to ensure energy justice while
                                fully following our global commitments for sustainable goals.

                                PM Modi said, India is the third largest and the fastest growing aviation market in
                                terms of domestic aviation. He said, India will always work keeping in mind global goals
                                and we are well on track to meet the commitment we made to the global community.

                                He said, we had aimed to increase the renewable energy installed capacity by 175 Giga
                                Watt by 2022 and we have further extended this goal to 450 Giga Watt by 2030.

                                He said, India has one of the lowest carbon emissions than rest of the industrialized
                                worlds.

                                The Prime Minister said, the country's refining capacity will increase from about 250 to
                                400 MMT per annum by 2025 and increasing domestic gas production has been a government
                                priority as well.

                                He said, the government has planned to achieve One Nation, One Gas Grid and shift
                                towards a gas-based economy.

                                The Prime Minister said, in the last six years, over 11 million smart LED street lights
                                were installed and this has enabled an estimated energy saving of 60 billion units per
                                year.

                                He said, the estimated greenhouse gas emission reduction with this programme is over 4.5
                                crore tonnes of CO2 annually.

                                He said, we also save around Rs. 24 thousand crore annually from the same.

                                Russia knocking Turkish drones from Armenian skies
                            </h5>
                            <p class="card-text">
                                The electronic warfare system is known as “Belladonna”, a poisonous plant that gets its
                                name from Renaissance women who used its extract for tinctures to dilate the pupils of
                                their eyes, ostensibly to make them more attractive.

                                While Belladonna translates to “beautiful woman” in English, in Russian it has a second
                                meaning: it is the name of a Russian electronic jamming system now credited with
                                knocking out at least nine Turkish Bayraktar armed drones used by Azerbaijan to target
                                Armenia.

                                If true – and no one has denied it – the system is now operating around the sensitive
                                Russian military base at Gyumri in Armenia, far from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict area.

                                In Russian, Belladonna is known as “Krasukha.” The Krasukha jamming system was rushed to
                                Armenia to counter the successful use of both armed drones such as the Bayraktar and
                                suicide drones like the Israel-made loitering munition known as Harop.

                                The Turks have heavily advertised the success of Bayraktar in three theaters – Syria,
                                Libya and now in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Turkey and Azerbaijan have released
                                numerous “kill videos” of the drone blowing up tanks, armored vehicles and trucks – and
                                killing many soldiers in the process.

                                Bayraktar is a fairly conventional armed drone that is navigated to the target area
                                using GPS. The drone’s Wescam MX-15D multispectral camera system is made in Canada while
                                its BRP-Rotax engine that generates about 100 horse-power is produced in Austria.

                                Canada has halted the sale of the Wescam camera system to Turkey because of its use on
                                Bayraktar drones in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. But Canada has been silent about
                                Rotax engine exports, although the Austrian company is owned by Canada’s Bombardier
                                Recreational Products.

                                No doubt there are other Bayraktar parts that are made in Europe, the United States and
                                elsewhere.

                                The Krasukha is a broadband multifunctional jamming station manufactured by KRET
                                (“Concern Radio Electronic Technologies”), part of the Rostec Group. Since 2014, the
                                company has been under US sanctions for its activities in Ukraine and in Crimea.

                                KRET consists of more than 70 member companies in electronics spread out across Russia
                                while KRET itself acts as a manufacturing group holding company with about 50,000
                                employees.

                                Krakushka was designed primarily to protect areas in and around Russia’s military bases
                                where its powerful transmitter can blank out airborne radars. The Russians, however,
                                have also found Krakuska useful in counteracting armed drones.

                                Krakushka was used successfully in defending the Hmeymim Air Base in Syria that was
                                attacked by armed, if not primitive, swarming drones. An earlier strike by such drones
                                had caused significant damage at the base, destroying some aircraft, and alarmed
                                Russia’s military about a significant vulnerability at Hmeymim.

                                So much so, in fact, that Russia’s defense ministry brought back some of the drones that
                                crashed and complained bitterly about the spread of drone technology in the Middle East.

                                The Russians might also have complained about China, which supplied the engines, the
                                cameras and the GPS receivers and radios in the drones that were home-built by ISIS and
                                others. But, of course, they did not want to stir trouble with their Beijing ally. For
                                the record, the Russians said the swarming drones caused no damage.

                                The Russian press claims that at least nine Bayraktar drones were shot down on or about
                                October 19. Some photos of the drones that crashed have been released by Armenia and
                                have appeared in the Russian press, principally at Avia.pro.

                                The photos show smashed up Bayraktar drones, but no sign they were hit by ground fire.
                                According to the press reports, the Krakushka jamming system caused the crashes.

                                The version of Krakushka being used in Armenia is the latest model Krakushka-4. The
                                system is truck-mounted, but is used primarily to defend Russian bases. So far as is
                                known, it is not being used by Armenian forces, nor is it being deployed in the
                                Nagorno-Karabakh area.

                                Krakushka jams communications in the same way it blanks out radars; it does not,
                                however, control the jammed drones. It would appear that the Bayraktar drone does not
                                have a “return to home” capability if it loses contact with its base station and if GPS
                                signals are jammed. Most drones with the capability to return to their home systems rely
                                on GPS to do so.

                                The Russians have made clear that the Turkish drones were shot down in the airspace
                                around the Gyumri military base, which in Armenia is near the Turkish border and about
                                487 kilometers from the nearest major Azerbaijani base at Ganja.

                                The reported communications range of the Turkish drones is 150 kilometers, so the
                                Azerbaijanis and the Turks would have had to move their launch point elsewhere to be
                                within operational range unless the communications range is greater than reported.

                                But the more profound question is why would the Azerbaijanis and the Turks fly armed
                                drones near Russian bases, risking Russia’s entrance into the conflict. Gyumri serves as
                                home to the 102nd Russian military base controlled by Russia’s Southern Military
                                District.

                                Were the drones sent on a one-way mission to fly over the area to put the Russians on
                                notice? It is interesting that in the photos of the crashed drones there is no sign of
                                any air-to-ground missiles such as the MAM-L smart micro munition built by Turkey’s
                                Rokestan.

                                Neither Azerbaijan nor Turkey has made any statement about having nine of their drones
                                knocked out in or around Gyumri. The Russian government likewise has not made an
                                official statement on the downed drones.

                                statement

                                The Foreign Office (FO) on Monday summoned the French ambassador, Marc Baréty, to lodge
                                a "strong protest" against the publication of blasphemous sketches and recent comments
                                made by French President Emmanuel Macron.

                                In a statement, FO Spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhry said that the ambassador was
                                handed over a dossier by the special secretary (Europe).

                                The ambassador was told about Pakistan's condemnation of the publication of blasphemous
                                sketches and the comments later made by Macron, the spokesperson said.

                                On Wednesday, Macron had criticised Islamists and vowed not to “give up cartoons”
                                depicting Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him). The French president also contended that
                                Samuel Paty, a teacher who was beheaded recently for showing the blasphemous sketches,
                                was “killed beca­use Islamists want our future”.
                                In the days that followed the beheading, the caricatures were projected onto the facade
                                of a building in one city and people displayed them at protests around the country.

                                The French envoy was conveyed Pakistan's "deep concerns over the recent systematic
                                resurgence of blasphemous acts of republication of caricatures of the Holy Prophet
                                Muhammad (PBUH) and desecration of the Holy Quran by certain irresponsible elements",
                                the FO spokesperson said.

                                It was underscored that such "illegal and Islamophobic acts" hurt the sentiments of
                                Muslims across the world and "could not be justified in the name of freedom of
                                expression", he added.

                                The ambassador was also told that Pakistan strongly condemned equating Islam with
                                terrorism "for narrow electoral and political gains", Chaudhry said, emphasising that
                                such provocative statements and actions were fanning inter-religious hatred and
                                confrontation.

                                "It was reiterated that freedom of expression should not be misused as [a] means to
                                attack or hurt public sentiments or religious beliefs," the spokesperson added.

                                "At a time of rising racism, intolerance and populism, there is a need to promote
                                harmony among peoples and communities instead of reinforcing stereotypes and making
                                people alienated."

                                In a statement carried by Radio Pakistan, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on
                                Monday that Macron's irresponsible statement had added "fuel to the fire".

                                "Nobody has the right to hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims under the guise of
                                freedom of expression," he said.

                                The foreign minister also urged the United Nations to take notice and called for action
                                against the hate-based narrative against Islam, the report added.

                                In the statement released today, Qureshi added that a comprehensive resolution will be
                                presented at the next Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) foreign ministers'
                                meeting proposing to observe March 15 as the International Day against Islamophobia.

                                'Pakistan seeks global legislation against blasphemy'
                                Speaking at a press conference, Special Representative of the Prime Minister on
                                Religious Harmony Hafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi said the government wanted legislation to
                                be conducted at the UN level which would criminalise blasphemy against all religions and
                                sacred personalities.

                                Ashrafi said Foreign Minister Qureshi, Prime Minister Imran Khan and he were in touch
                                with the leadership of Muslim and non-Muslim countries, organisations working on
                                inter-faith harmony and the OIC to accomplish this.

                                He announced that the government will constitute 'inter-faith harmony councils' across
                                the country which will operate from the Centre to the Union Council levels.

                                Answering a question, he said "no country has played a better role than Pakistan" on the
                                issue of blasphemous sketches in the past two days and the Muslim world was praising
                                Pakistan's stance on the matter.

                                Asked whether the government was considering boycotting French products, Ashrafi said
                                the government was moving ahead "step by step" and instead of taking emotional measures,
                                it wanted a permanent solution to the issue.

                                In a tweet earlier in the day, Ashrafi said the issue of blasphemous sketches would be
                                taken up by the OIC. He said that France had hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims
                                during the month of Rabiul Awwal.

                                PM Imran denounces Macron's comments
                                The summoning of the French ambassador comes a day after Prime Minister Imran denounced
                                Macron’s remarks on blasphemous caricatures, calling them “encouragement of
                                Islamophobia”, and wrote to Facebook CEO Mark Mark Zuckerberg seeking a ban on
                                Islamophobic content on the social media site.

                                In a series of tweets, PM Imran said the sign of a leader was that he united people like
                                former South African president Nelson Mandela.

                                The premier regretted that the French president had instead chosen to encourage
                                Islamophobia by “attacking Islam rather than the terrorists who carry out violence, be
                                it Muslims, white supremacists or Nazi ideologists”.

                                “By attacking Islam, clearly without having any understanding of it, Macron has attacked
                                and hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims in Europe and across the world,” he said,
                                adding that, “the last thing the world wants or needs is further polarisation”.

                                Public statements based on ignorance will create more hate, Islamophobia and space for
                                extremists, he said.

                                Meanwhile, in a letter addressed to Facebook's CEO, the prime minister asked the social
                                media giant to place a ban on Islamophobia and hate against Islam just as it had placed
                                on the Holocaust.

                                “I am writing to draw your attention to the growing Islamophobia that is encouraging
                                hate, extremism and violence across the world and especially through the use of social
                                media platforms including Facebook. I appreciate your taking the step to rightly ban any
                                posting that criticises or questions the Holocaust, which was the culmination of the
                                Nazi pogrom of the Jews in Germany and across Europe as Nazis spread across Europe," he
                                said in the letter.

                                “Given the rampant abuse and vilification of Muslims on social media platforms, I would
                                ask you to place a similar ban on Islamophobia and hate against Islam for Facebook that
                                you have put in place for the Holocaust,” he added.

                                'Systematic resurgence' of blasphemous acts
                                The Foreign Office on Sunday also issued a statement saying Pakistan condemned in the
                                strongest manner the systematic resurgence of blasphemous acts of republication of
                                caricatures of the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) and desecration of the Holy Quran by
                                certain irresponsible elements in some developed countries.

                                “We are further alarmed at highly disturbing statements by certain politicians
                                justifying such heinous acts under the garb of freedom of expression and equating Islam
                                with terrorism, for narrow electoral and political gains,” the statement said.

                                It said that under international human rights law, the exercise of the right to freedom
                                of expression carried with it special duties and responsibilities.
